### (a) think about
* `about`是`on by out`三个单词的简称，表示`“在旁边，在外面”`。
* `about`之所以有`大约的`意思，是因为`就是不精准`，在周围，在旁边，在外围。
* `think about`的意思，指的是`想一件事情周边的详细情况`或者
  `想与某一个人有关的事儿`。

### (b) think of

* `of`是`blong to`，即`......的`。例如：a friend `of` mine, 我的一个朋友。
* `of`指的是与这个人或这件事本身相关的情况。

```
I'm thinking about you. 我在想和你有关的事儿。# 不是在想你这个人
I'm thinking of    you. 我在想你这个人。      # 不是在想和你有关的事儿
